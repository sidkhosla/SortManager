# SortManager
This is my Java Core project
--------
To Use The Sort Manager,

Please run the starter file in the Starter Package.
--------
After running the project you will be able to choose between 6 sorting algorithms.

You will choose the size of the array you want to get sorted.

You will also choose what is the range of the elements in the array should be.

Finally the sorter will give you your array genrated before and after the sort by the chosen algorithm.

The program will also provide you the time it took to give you the result in nano seconds.
